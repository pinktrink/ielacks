# IE Lacks
A list of things IE lacks that they might want to implement before developers consider them a competent browser. Not saying they'll be considered a competent browser given their current track record. It may take a few versions, but if they can keep up-to-date and not try to just implement their own standards without regard to overall support, who knows. They may gain more market share.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Use JS or some shit like that to dynamically load/organize lists
- [ ] Separate CSS/HTML/SVG/HTTP/Whatever
- [x] Keep it simple (this site is insanely simple, frameworks are a no-no)
- [ ] Add leading IE version for XP (until it is considerably below market share)
- [ ] Make the stylesheet its own file (beware, here be dragons)
- [x] Other shit
- [x] Profane commit messages

## Contributing
Send a pull request. If people are all like "fix this" then fix it or don't. Fixing it comes with the added benefit of your formerly-shitty PR being merged.

## Will IE ever be a competent browser?
Don't count your damn chickens.

## Want brownie points from basically everyone?
Compile a figure of how much money IE has lost companies (developer time) compared to other browsers. Leave the developers to weep. Bask in the brownie points.

## Why care about IE?
I feel you, sister/brother. Unfortunately business requires us to. If you want to force them to catch up, just build shit without browser requirements, using the latest and greatest. If it gets big enough, maybe they'll really start considering it. But once again, don't count your damn chickens.

## Why did you create this?
I've been working with IE since before 5. The fact that they haven't gotten their shit together/disappeared completely yet should be a good indicator.
